# Professional REST API with Python, Flask, Docker, Flask-Smorest, and Flask-SQLAlchemy

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build professional REST APIs using Python with Flask, Docker, Flask-Smorest, and Flask-SQLAlchemy. The API allows for the creation, manipulation, and management of stores and items, providing a robust and scalable solution for handling various operations related to these entities.

## Features

- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Develop and interact with RESTful endpoints to manage stores and items.
- **Data Manipulation**: Perform operations such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on stores and items.
- **Docker Integration**: Utilize Docker for containerizing the application, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment.
- **API Testing**: Use Insomnia (or other API clients) to send requests and test API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the API.
- **Flask**: Micro web framework for building the API.
- **Flask-Smorest**: Extension for Flask that simplifies API creation and documentation.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: Extension for Flask that integrates SQLAlchemy for database operations.
- **Docker**: Platform for containerizing the application to ensure consistency across different environments.
- **Insomnia**: Tool for sending API requests and testing endpoints.
